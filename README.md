# MarsOasis Mini App

#### Mars Oasis is a new gaming paradigm. As a TON-native game, Mars Oasis seamlessly blends social gameplay with public good, fostering a relaxed and privacy-conscious social network, aiming to build a gamified on-chain distribution platform that encourages on-chain activity among 1 billion Telegram and TON users.

#### As a mini-adventure game themed around Mars exploration and settlement, Mars Oasis allows Telegram users to engage in casual gameplay during their spare moments while connecting lightly with friends and contributing to the global public good. Through a gamified experience, Mars Oasis encourages users to develop on-chain transaction habits, reducing their dependence on centralized systems and ultimately creating an entry point for on-chain traffic.

#### Mars Oasis envisions an evolutionary narrative of Martian civilization spanning multiple eras. In 2030, a leader named E announces a regular interplanetary travel program between Earth and Mars, marking the beginning of humanity's sustainable civilization on Mars, known as Mars Oasis. To address Mars's oxygen deficiency and enhance its ecosystem, humanity begins cultivating trees on the Martian surface. This marks the start of the first era on Mars—The Oasis Era (2030 - 2070).

#### During this period, trees become an invaluable asset on Mars. In response, the first settlers decide to issue Mars’s universal currency based on the total number of trees planted, incentivizing everyone to participate in transforming Mars's ecological landscape.

#### In the Mars Oasis game, players take on the role of settlers managing limited resources, such as energy obtained through on-chain activities on the TON network. These resources are used to plant trees, produce oxygen, and transform the ecosystem. Additionally, players can cooperate with friends to accelerate progress in the game.
